If you find any bug or demand any other features, please let me know by reporting [issues](https://github.com/HC200ok/vue3-easy-data-table/issues).

Making PR is very welcomed!


Sometimes I announced on Reddit after I released some new features, so shout out to the people:
- Who upvoted on Reddit 
- Who made cool feature requests
- Who reported issues
- Who made PR
- Who gave a github star‚≠ê
